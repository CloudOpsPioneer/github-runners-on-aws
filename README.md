**Please Note:** This repo is only for learning purposes. I didn't implement modules for Terraform since I wanted to understand how the Terraform resources needed to be configured to deploy resources. For production deployment, You can check for modules in terraform documentation and implement them to deploy any AWS resources.<br>
